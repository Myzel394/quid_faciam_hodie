## Hint for the jury

The app can run directly after building it. All API Keys are stored in code.
To protect them from simple bots, they are converted to base64.
Once the Hackathon is over, all API keys will be removed.

By default, this app will use the Supabase project from me (Myzel394).
I do not share your data and I do not download it.
If you want to host your own Supabase project (which is highly recommended), you can replace your
own API key under `lib/constants/apis.dart`;

You will need to replace `SUPABASE_API_URL` to your URL and `SUPABASE_API_URL` to your API key.

Aaaaaand most importantly:

Have fun! :smile:
